# Advanced-MindBlock-Compiler

This compiler was made as part of a 400 level Programming Languages course. it consists of a tokenizer, parser, and python code to create runnable C code from the parse tree.

# Tokenizer

The tokenizer takes in a '.amb' file. It will tokenize symbols, keywords, integers, labels, and strings. Tokens are all subclasses of a 'Token' class. For example START_PROGRAM would tokenize into a START_PROGRAM object that's a subclass of the Token class.

A list of tokens is returned, in order, to the parse tree.
